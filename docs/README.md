# Welcome to the addon-self-administration wiki for the LTS version 1.0!

The add-on self administration is not ready to be deployed and used as a single project. If you like to use the self administration anyway, please use a earlier version integrated as the registration module in the OSIAM server. The needed information can be found at https://github.com/osiam/server/wiki/OSIAM-Registration-Module-until-version-0.17.1

This add-on for the [OSIAM server](https://github.com/osiam/server/wiki) contains the three administration mechanisms mentioned [below](#the-three-self-administration-mechanisms).
